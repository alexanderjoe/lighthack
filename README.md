# ETC Lighthack (Personal Version)

I wanted to try my hand at a hardware project since I have never done one before, but I wanted to build something useful. One of my passions is theatre and we have an ETC Element 2 lighting console. One downside is it has no encoder wheels for controling fixtures with pan/tilt

Inspired by (ETC Lighthack)[https://github.com/ETCLabs/lighthack/tree/master]

## Description
This project uses an Arduino Uno R4 Wifi with two KY-040 encoders and an LCD display to create a set of encoder wheels that can be used to control the pan and tilt of fixtures on an ETC Element 2 lighting console or ETC's Nomad software. The encoder wheels can be rotated to adjust the pan and tilt values, and the LCD display shows the current values.


## Components
- Arduino Uno R4 Wifi
- KY-040 Encoder
- Hosyond I2C IIC 1602 LCD Display
- Cherry MX Switch
